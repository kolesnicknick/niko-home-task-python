As you can see I separated component test, which is E2E and unit tests

For unit tests I tried to go method - over - method and cover the main functionality of it.
I covered positive cases, negative cases, boundary values, equivalent partitioning and so on.
Most of method names are describing what test method is trying to do.

For some cases, I believe functionality of main class should be updated, so I created tests that fail now,
 but with the fix of main class and adding those features - would be working well. So it is kind of TDD, when we create test first and then add functionality to make test pass

In general - most of cases are covered in unit tests, but there are some tests that from my opinion are good to be covered on E2E level in component tests
